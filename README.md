# x-img

Public repository: [github.com/sagrudd/x-img](https://github.com/sagrudd/x-img)

`x-img` is a planned personal acquisition and review service for a small,
explicitly configured set of X/Twitter and Instagram accounts, user-identified
public GEO/SRA/ENA/NCBI resources, and websites enabled through a Firefox
extension.

All sources resolve to one x-img Web instance. That instance presents a
thumbnail-dense, ThumbsPlus-inspired library and review queue, and offers a
single-click refresh of configured social accounts.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Rust implementation with `clap` for CLI surfaces, `axum` for HTTP/API
  adapters, and `yew` for the Web UI.
- Interface hosting and login are owned by sibling `../monas`; x-img must not
  create a competing account or session system.
- Image and video bytes are stored only in a DASObjectStore ObjectStore through
  sibling `../DASObjectStore`; local x-img state may contain configuration,
  identifiers, indexes, and audit records, but never durable media payloads.
- Account and site configuration is local, explicit, versioned JSON.
- Bioinformatics acquisition is explicit and user-initiated: an accession or
  URL becomes a reviewable transfer plan before bounded streaming to the
  configured DASObjectStore ObjectStore. x-img does not bulk-discover or crawl
  public repositories.
- Storage endpoints/devices are separate from logical ObjectStores. The
  default local folder profile is provisioned by the authorized DASObjectStore
  service; remote endpoints are paired through Monas/DASObjectStore, expose all
  stores visible to the user, and require explicit endpoint-plus-store review
  before every write. x-img never writes an unmanaged folder or silently
  changes a reviewed destination.
- Video-focused websites may offer a user-selected, policy-gated review pane.
  Only observed or explicitly selected candidates enter it; normalized,
  checksum-verified, Firefox-tested renditions are stored as typed
  DASObjectStore objects before they are advertised as playable.
- Acquisition is idempotent: once a media identity has a verified committed
  object, routine refreshes do not download it again.
- The UI follows sibling `../mnemosyne_design_language` and retains a future
  Synoptikon adapter boundary for `../mnemosyne`.
- The source repository is public and licensed under MPL-2.0. Archived media is
  private user data and is never committed to this repository.

## Current status

The `0.2.0` Rust workspace scaffold is available: shared model and core
boundaries, a `clap` CLI, an Axum composition boundary, and a Yew client
boundary compile without enabling any live source, storage, authentication, or
media-payload integration. See [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md) for release gates
and [TODO.md](TODO.md) for dependency-ordered work. Automated contributors must
follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

The CLI now strictly validates, lists, and atomically replaces local versioned
account/site configuration; it performs no network access or source refresh.
See [configuration documentation](docs/configuration.rst) for commands and
fail-closed validation rules.

The Rust core also enforces the acquisition lifecycle through verified object
commit and review admission. It is an in-memory policy boundary only; it does
not transfer media, contact an authority, or persist acquisition state. See
[acquisition lifecycle documentation](docs/acquisition.rst).

The core's reconciliation catalogue keys committed metadata by canonical media
identity plus immutable checksum. Replays reuse the first committed object
reference and append safe URL aliases; checksum disagreement becomes an
explicit conflict. It remains in-memory and performs no storage query or write.

The scheduler contract coalesces repeated refreshes, prevents concurrent work
for one source, bounds child capacity and cost usage, and releases leases on
cancellation. It remains an in-memory contract and does not execute any job.

Synthetic fixture coverage for X and Instagram is versioned and deterministic;
it exercises connector edge cases without network access or credentials and
does not authorize a live connector.

The core also validates one explicit bioinformatics transfer plan before any
future job: it requires reviewable source, file/checksum, rights, and stable
ObjectStore destination evidence, with policy blocking and confirmation kept
separate from transfer.

The supported-toolchain, browser, Semantic Versioning, dependency, fixture,
CI, documentation, and Definition of Done rules are maintained in the
[release and quality policy](docs/release-quality-policy.rst). Run the
dependency-free planning checks with `scripts/quality/check.sh`; the pinned
local Sphinx container remains the documentation release authority.

The v1.0.0 product and brand target is **Pinakotheke**. Until the coordinated
release migration is complete, this public planning repository remains
`sagrudd/x-img`; the target repository slug is `sagrudd/pinakotheke` and all
compatibility aliases and migrations must be documented before that move.
The [Pinakotheke identity migration guide](docs/identity-migration.rst) records
the staged cutover, compatibility window, immutable data identities, and
rollback constraints.

## Key concerns before implementation

1. X and Instagram access, storage, display, and deletion obligations must be
   reviewed against current platform terms and the user's rights to each work.
2. Protected/private account access requires an official user-authorized flow;
   browser cookies and credentials must never be scraped or copied into x-img.
3. “Exactly once” is implemented as idempotent committed acquisition, not as an
   impossible promise that a network request can never be retried after a crash.
4. Video caching requires byte-range and segmented-media behavior to be proven
   in Firefox before the external-cache design is declared viable.
5. The public project must not redistribute downloaded media, tokens, account
   lists, DAS credentials, or Monas sessions.
6. Firefox capture and substitution are per-site opt-in and fail-open: the
   extension never automatically opens pages, traverses hidden content,
   bulk-crawls, simulates browsing, or forwards site cookies/credentials;
   thumbnails are eligible only after display/observation and originals only
   after an explicit user open. Avoiding an API does not exempt behavior from
   platform terms.
7. GEO, SRA, ENA, and NCBI resources require explicit accession/URL selection,
   rights/policy review, destination confirmation, checksum verification, and
   provenance; controlled-access or license-uncertain resources remain blocked.
8. Endpoint/device identity, logical ObjectStore identity, pairing, capability,
   health, quota, and TLS state are authority-owned; extension/browser storage
   never contains raw passwords, S3 secrets, or broad tokens.
9. Video normalization uses versioned, evidence-backed playback profiles and a
   pinned containerized FFmpeg adapter. DRM, unsupported media, rights-
   uncertain sources, and source-only renditions remain explicitly blocked or
   failed; browser capture does not avoid platform terms.

## Versioning

The project uses Semantic Versioning. The workspace package version is the
single product-version authority and is currently `0.2.0`; the stable
connector, storage, Web, and Firefox contracts are the `1.0.0` gate.
