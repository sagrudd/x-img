# Pinakotheke

Public repository: [github.com/sagrudd/pinakotheke](https://github.com/sagrudd/pinakotheke)

Pinakotheke is a personal acquisition and review service for a small,
explicitly configured set of X/Twitter and Instagram accounts, user-identified
public GEO/SRA/ENA/NCBI resources, and websites enabled through a Firefox
extension.

All sources resolve to one Pinakotheke Web instance. That instance presents a
thumbnail-dense, ThumbsPlus-inspired library and review queue, and offers a
single-click refresh of configured social accounts.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Rust implementation with `clap` for CLI surfaces, `axum` for HTTP/API
  adapters, and `yew` for the Web UI.
- Interface hosting and login are owned by sibling `../monas`; Pinakotheke must not
  create a competing account or session system.
- Image and video bytes are stored only in a DASObjectStore ObjectStore through
  sibling `../DASObjectStore`; local Pinakotheke state may contain configuration,
  identifiers, indexes, and audit records, but never durable media payloads.
- Account and site configuration is local, explicit, versioned JSON.
- Bioinformatics acquisition is explicit and user-initiated: an accession or
  URL becomes a reviewable transfer plan before bounded streaming to the
  configured DASObjectStore ObjectStore. Pinakotheke does not bulk-discover or crawl
  public repositories.
- Storage endpoints/devices are separate from logical ObjectStores. The
  default local folder profile is provisioned by the authorized DASObjectStore
  service; remote endpoints are paired through Monas/DASObjectStore, expose all
  stores visible to the user, and require explicit endpoint-plus-store review
  before every write. Pinakotheke never writes an unmanaged folder or silently
  changes a reviewed destination.
- Video-focused websites may offer a user-selected, policy-gated review pane.
  Only observed or explicitly selected candidates enter it; normalized,
  checksum-verified, Firefox-tested renditions are stored as typed
  DASObjectStore objects before they are advertised as playable.
  Candidate planning records aggregate unusual codec combinations for
  prioritisation without sending individual browsing URLs, media, cookies, or
  credentials to project diagnostics or tickets.
- Video normalization is Docker-first and may execute only on an authorized
  DASObjectStore host, paired device worker, or future governed worker. Every
  plan pins an image digest and resource bounds; durable source and derived
  bytes remain DASObjectStore objects. See
  [normalized-video profile documentation](docs/normalized-video-profiles.rst).
  The first adapter is an explicitly paired-device worker with network-isolated,
  digest-pinned Docker/FFmpeg execution and bounded ephemeral scratch; it
  streams all derived objects to DASObjectStore before cleanup. See
  [video normalization](docs/video-normalization.rst).
- Acquisition is idempotent: once a media identity has a verified committed
  object, routine refreshes do not download it again.
- The UI follows sibling `../mnemosyne_design_language` and retains a future
  Synoptikon adapter boundary for `../mnemosyne`.
- The source repository is public and licensed under MPL-2.0. Archived media is
  private user data and is never committed to this repository.

## Current status

The canonical `v1.0.0` Pinakotheke release is available from the
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/sagrudd/pinakotheke/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
with thirteen verified artifacts, checksums, a typed manifest, CycloneDX SBOM,
and local release evidence. The earlier unsigned `v0.9.0` x-img evaluation
release remains available from its historical
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/sagrudd/x-img/releases/tag/v0.9.0),
with checksums, typed artifact manifest, CycloneDX SBOM, explicit limitations,
and dual-architecture upgrade/rollback evidence.

The `1.27.4` development workspace provides shared model and core boundaries, a `clap`
CLI, an Axum composition boundary, and a Yew client boundary. It compiles
without enabling unconfigured source, storage, authentication, or media-payload
integration. The first local monolith slice can now run a loopback Axum service
with an isolated private metadata root. Explicit local-profile commands now
provision and discover a named DASObjectStore-managed ObjectStore without
granting Pinakotheke direct filesystem authority. Monas authentication
composes through the Monas ``0.8.4`` authenticated forwarding/login shell and a
fail-closed, process-credentialed backend boundary. Pinakotheke does not parse
Monas cookies or issue sessions. Monas revokes all browser sessions on process
startup, so a host restart requires a fresh login instead of accepting a
persisted cookie. Legacy local accounts are upgraded through Prosopikon's
digest-guarded immutable-identity migration before login. A non-root macOS
``launchd`` manager controls
the two coordinated agents without deleting application data. See
[local monolith](docs/local-monolith.rst) and
[MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md) for release gates
and [TODO.md](TODO.md) for dependency-ordered work. Automated contributors must
follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Production HTTPS is terminated directly by the Rust/Axum service; nginx is not
part of the Pinakotheke request path. Certificate trust, issuance, deployment,
rotation, and the reusable Mnemosyne pattern are defined in
[TRUSTED_CERTIFICATES_AND_AXUM.md](TRUSTED_CERTIFICATES_AND_AXUM.md).

The Monas-authenticated gallery now loads a strict, bounded, atomically replaced
metadata catalogue from ``state/gallery-catalogue.v1.json`` below the monolith
root. It retains only review metadata and verified DASObjectStore references;
media bytes are never stored in the Pinakotheke root. Missing state is empty,
while corrupt, future-schema, oversized, or symlinked state fails closed.
Verified Firefox image admission now joins committed acquisition evidence and
the common website review queue to this store. Displayed thumbnails are
lookup-only and create no new cards; an explicitly opened and independently
committed original creates the card. Historic thumbnail-only cards remain
readable. Uncommitted, destination-changing, and conflicting
replays are rejected, and delivery paths are generated server-side.
For an enabled image site, a trusted click on an image link (or an image
document) can submit the explicitly opened original through the same capture
plan. Synthetic clicks and unlinked thumbnail clicks are rejected, and the
generic adapter applies to arbitrary HTTPS origins only after explicit site
permission and opt-in.
That exact-origin observer persists across ordinary Firefox restarts, is
restored after extension updates, and is removed when capture is paused or the
site is removed. No repeated per-page toolbar action or broad tab/history
permission is required.
Linked thumbnails now carry a separate canonical presentation identity. The
trusted opened-original event reuses that identity, allowing distinct
thumbnail and original URLs to enrich one server-owned gallery card without
guessing or collapsing other images on the page.
Those paths now resolve only through the persisted catalogue and a
Monas-authenticated, host-supplied DASObjectStore streaming-read backend.
Pinakotheke validates MIME type, length, checksum, and ETag and streams without
local persistence or origin fallback. The packaged CLI now implements the
first-party read helper through explicit endpoint/store-to-bucket authority and
a host-owned scoped AWS profile; complete and ranged reads use private bounded
ephemeral scratch which is deleted before the helper exits. A future daemon-
native DAS read can replace this transport behind the unchanged helper port.
Verified normalized-video records with matching Firefox profile evidence can
now persist as one card containing separate DASObjectStore poster and rendition
references. The poster uses authenticated image delivery and the rendition uses
authenticated single-range playback with strict MIME, length, checksum, ETag,
and range validation. Planned, source-only, unproven, or conflicting video is
not catalogue-ready.
Catalogue browsing now applies bounded source, media, review, availability,
time, and metadata-text filters on the authenticated server before stable
pagination. The Yew library preserves source/text queries while loading
explicit 100-record pages and reports matching and total counts, avoiding the
former silent 200-card truncation. A responsive overscanned viewport keeps the
number of rendered cards bounded and retains Arrow/Home/End keyboard traversal
across loaded records that begin off-screen.
``make web`` now builds the actual Yew application as hashed Trunk/WASM assets.
Native packages install that exact bundle and compile its platform installation
path into the monolith. A local ``~/.x-img/web`` tree or explicit
``--web-root`` takes precedence for development. Every selected tree is
bounded and symlink-free, and is served only through the Monas-authenticated
canonical application path; direct backend requests are denied.
``make firefox-gallery-check`` exercises that compiled bundle in installed
Firefox with 1,000 ephemeral mixed records, bounded windowing, keyboard focus,
server filtering, unavailable/no-origin behavior, and desktop/narrow reflow.
It is browser-component evidence and does not replace live authority proof.
``make critical-vertical-check VIDEO=/ephemeral/normalized.mp4`` assembles that
browser proof with lookup-only thumbnails and trusted-open capture, verified
settlement/restart tests, and real Firefox normalized playback. See the
[critical vertical acceptance guide](docs/critical-vertical.rst) for the exact
scope and the separately recorded live DASObjectStore authority evidence.

The monolith can compose a reviewed DASObjectStore/host reader with
``--object-read-helper``. The versioned process protocol carries only immutable
object identity and bounded response metadata; payload bytes stream directly
to the authenticated Axum route with length/full-response checksum
verification and no local payload file. Authentication and secret resolution
remain entirely inside the host-supplied helper.
Object identity includes the authority's explicit positive immutable version;
legacy catalogue-v1 records default to version 1, while new records persist and
forward the exact version required by DASObjectStore provider streams.
For a managed macOS service, the helper path and reviewed endpoint identity are
an inseparable pair. The fixed identity is supplied to the helper as
``PINAKOTHEKE_OBJECT_READ_ENDPOINT_ID``; it is not copied from a browser
request and is not an authentication credential.
The runnable monolith also mounts its existing Firefox capture-plan contract
behind Monas when given a strict private ``--capture-authority-file``. This file
contains only opaque pairing/actor references and explicit per-origin policy;
accepted plans remain metadata awaiting verified acquisition and are not
misrepresented as stored media.
Accepted plan metadata is atomically journalled beneath the private product
state root. Retries are idempotent across restart, daily page budgets survive a
restart, and an authenticated actor can list only their own pending plans.
A separately credentialled host worker can report an independently verified
DASObjectStore image commit through the strict completion boundary. Successful
completion updates the live gallery and persistent review card before retaining
a restart-safe settled marker; Firefox cannot invoke this with its pairing or
Monas session alone.
``pinakotheke capture acquire`` runs one pending image through a reviewed host
executable using a strict metadata-only protocol. The helper owns source
retrieval and DASObjectStore authorization, uses only bounded isolated
ephemeral scratch or bounded streaming to the authority, and returns only a
verified receipt; Pinakotheke rejects stdout
payloads, changed destinations, malformed schemas, and non-zero exits.
The monolith can use that same adapter continuously with
``--capture-acquire-helper``. Admission returns promptly, identical concurrent
work is coalesced, helper execution is serialized, verified success updates the
live gallery, and every failure remains pending without a false stored badge.
On restart, eligible durable pending plans are revalidated and requeued without
a browser retry. Expired/revoked pairings, disabled sites, changed adapters, and
settled records are not executed.

The packaged ``pinakotheke`` binary is now a concrete implementation of that
image-acquisition helper seam. It performs bounded HTTPS retrieval into private
ephemeral scratch, submits a checksum-keyed upload through the paired
``dasobjectstore-remote`` daemon-completion path, requires verified ``Complete``
evidence, emits metadata only, and removes scratch on every outcome. DAS
credentials remain inside the DASObjectStore remote-client or site
credential-helper boundary.

The release hardening path now includes one deterministic fault/recovery
command, ``scripts/faults/check.sh``. It covers critical authority, ingest,
scheduler, normalizer, and Firefox fail-open boundaries using synthetic data;
see [fault injection and recovery](docs/fault-injection-recovery.rst).

Checksummed metadata snapshots now provide a tested copy-on-write recovery path
for configuration, immutable catalogue references, and non-secret pairing
identity. Restore produces a validated review candidate rather than overwriting
live state; see [migration, export, and restore](docs/migration-export-restore.rst).

Approved deletion/compliance actions now use an explicit metadata lifecycle:
catalogue visibility is tombstoned first, while durable object removal requires
a separately approved exact-object request and matching DASObjectStore
verification. See [deletion and compliance reconciliation](docs/deletion-compliance.rst).

The authenticated quick viewer now offers an explicit deletion review for
images and normalized videos. It removes every exact DASObjectStore
representation through a reviewed host adapter before removing the persistent
gallery projection; failures remain visible and retryable, and raw provider
deletion is never treated as authoritative completion.

Operational readiness now has separate coarse public health and authenticated,
redacted component/metric/audit snapshots. The bounded typed schema cannot hold
URLs, browsing history, credentials, sessions, object keys, or media payloads;
see [health, metrics, and audit](docs/operations.rst).

The reproducible release audit is ``scripts/audit/check.sh``. It checks privacy,
security, accessibility, Firefox permissions/CSP, MPL/SPDX coverage, locked
dependency advisories/licenses/sources, JavaScript syntax, and every product
version mirror; see [release audits](docs/release-audits.rst).

Local native and browser packages are driven by the top-level ``Makefile``:
DEB/RPM for Linux x86_64 and arm64, PKG for macOS x86_64 and arm64, and
deterministic Firefox XPIs labelled for macOS/Windows/Linux on both
architectures. See [native packages and Firefox bundles](docs/packaging.rst).

``make upgrade-rollback BASELINE_DIST=/path/to/prior/artifacts
BASELINE_VERSION=0.2.0`` exercises genuine DEB/RPM upgrade and downgrade on
x86_64 and arm64 in network-isolated digest-pinned containers, checks exact
metadata preservation, and validates the pinned Monas and DASObjectStore
authority contracts. See
[install, upgrade, and rollback acceptance](docs/upgrade-rollback-acceptance.rst).

The CLI now strictly validates, lists, and atomically replaces local versioned
account/site configuration; it performs no network access or source refresh.
See [configuration documentation](docs/configuration.rst) for commands and
fail-closed validation rules.

The Rust core also enforces the acquisition lifecycle through verified object
commit and review admission. It is an in-memory policy boundary only; it does
not transfer media, contact an authority, or persist acquisition state. See
[acquisition lifecycle documentation](docs/acquisition.rst).

The core's reconciliation catalogue keys committed metadata by canonical media
identity plus immutable checksum. Replays reuse the first committed object
reference and append safe URL aliases; checksum disagreement becomes an
explicit conflict. It remains in-memory and performs no storage query or write.

The scheduler contract coalesces repeated refreshes, prevents concurrent work
for one source, bounds child capacity and cost usage, and releases leases on
cancellation. It remains an in-memory contract and does not execute any job.

Synthetic fixture coverage for X and Instagram is versioned and deterministic;
it exercises connector edge cases without network access or credentials and
does not authorize a live connector.

The core also validates one explicit bioinformatics transfer plan before any
future job: it requires reviewable source, file/checksum, rights, and stable
ObjectStore destination evidence, with policy blocking and confirmation kept
separate from transfer.

Confirmed bioinformatics files now stream through the existing bounded ingest
port only after plan confirmation and destination revalidation; their verified
receipt produces metadata-only provenance and deterministic in-memory replay.
No provider, authority, or local payload transport is enabled. See
[confirmed bioinformatics commits](docs/bioinformatics-commit.rst).

x-img also has a fixture-tested official X OAuth 2.0 + S256 PKCE host boundary:
Monas owns verifier, secret, token, refresh, and revocation custody while x-img
keeps opaque references only. Live X API/media access remains blocked on ADR
0002 approval and rights gates. See [X OAuth authorization](docs/x-oauth.rst).

Followed X accounts can now enter the local allowlist only through a
fixture-tested review preview: the user selects returned stable account IDs,
reviews added/already-configured/not-selected rows, then explicitly confirms a
complete candidate configuration for atomic save. It contains no live X call or
bulk import, and remains subject to ADR 0002. See
[followed-account selection](docs/x-followed-accounts.rst).

The core also plans incremental X media discovery from synthetic adapter pages:
it bounds cursors, timeline depth, pages, and items; selects the best supported
photo/video/animated-GIF rendition; records complete metadata provenance; and
feeds canonical identity plus checksum into the existing idempotency boundary.
It does not call X or transfer media while ADR 0002 remains open. See
[incremental X media discovery](docs/x-media-discovery.rst).

Instagram is supported first as an explicitly enabled Firefox website policy:
the extension may submit only media actually displayed to the user, never
forwards cookies or credentials, never automates browsing, and fails open to
the origin. A dedicated Instagram API connector is optional future work, not a
requirement for this path.

Firefox viewport observation is lookup-only. The extension submits an image
capture plan only after a trusted user open and a video plan only after trusted
user-started playback; x-img checks the paired actor, site policy, adapter, and
candidate bound before adding either redacted plan to the common scheduler. It
does not accept browser media bytes or mark anything as stored. See [Firefox
capture plans](docs/firefox-capture.rst).

The packaged manifest uses Firefox's background-script declaration while
retaining the service-worker declaration for compatible browsers. On macOS,
``make firefox-capture-check`` installs an isolated temporary test copy in real
Firefox and proves that an observed linked thumbnail and a trusted user-opened
original reach the production capture-plan path. The harness also covers
explicitly enabled HTTPS sites on non-default ports: policy and provenance keep
the exact port even though Firefox match patterns are port-independent.

For an explicitly enabled site, a toolbar action can now replace a visible
proven alias with its exact reviewed DASObjectStore image. The authenticated
delivery route streams bytes without local persistence; Firefox validates the
MIME type, length, checksum ETag, and bounded payload before using an ephemeral
blob URL, and restores the ordinary origin image once on any failure. See
[image substitution](docs/image-substitution.rst).

Verified normalized MP4 aliases can use the same opted-in external cache while
preserving native Firefox range, seek, pause/resume, cancellation, and
conditional-request behavior. Only explicitly opened, ready normalized
renditions qualify; any delivery failure restores the origin video once. See
[normalized MP4 substitution](docs/mp4-substitution.rst).

Segmented HLS/DASH and MSE sources have a site-neutral, metadata-only planning
contract for resources already observed while the user played media. It accepts
only a bounded ordered identity set, produces an idempotent plan, and blocks
DRM, encryption, hidden traversal, authorization context, and incomplete proof.
Playback remains origin-served until the exact adapter also has real-Firefox
evidence and a matching Ready normalized rendition. See
[segmented video gating](docs/segmented-video-gate.rst).

The authenticated library has a dedicated **Playable videos** context. New
normalized cards retain their committed poster, duration, dimensions, codecs,
playback profile, capture time, source label, and Firefox verification state.
The keyboard-accessible quick viewer uses only the authorized host-local
DASObjectStore range route; installed Firefox evidence covers metadata loading,
seeking, concurrent ranges, pause/resume, missing-object handling, and absence
of source-site fallback. See [quick preview](docs/quick-preview.rst).

The Firefox toolbar exposes the active site's capture/substitution state,
pause/resume and explicit run controls, its latest coarse cache result, and the
distinct evidence labels `Previously observed` and `Stored in ObjectStore`.
Diagnostics are bounded and URL-free; ordinary origin loading remains the
fallback. See [Firefox cache toolbar](docs/firefox-toolbar.rst).

Verified website captures can now enter the same `New` review queue as account
media. Their site, page, media alias, discovery time, and adapter provenance
are retained; a matching committed connector alias reuses its canonical
identity instead of creating a duplicate. See
[website capture review admission](docs/website-capture-review.rst).

One authenticated refresh action now has a fixture-tested orchestration model:
it selects all enabled social accounts, coalesces repeat presses, exposes
per-account bounded progress and terminal states, supports cancellation/retry,
and produces a final summary. It executes no connector or media work. See
[one-click account refresh](docs/account-refresh.rst).

x-img now carries a strict, versioned Monas product-registration contract for
one authenticated application/API mount, a DASObjectStore requirement, and a
future Synoptikon-equivalent bootstrap. It declares no x-img login/session
route; a later host-context adapter will enforce the registered host context at
the live Axum boundary. See [Monas product registration](docs/monas-product.rst).

Privileged API routes now require a host-injected, non-secret authenticated
context and reject direct requests. Monas and a future Synoptikon adapter share
the same fixture-tested boundary; x-img never parses or retains session cookies
or credentials. See [authenticated host context](docs/host-context.rst).

x-img also carries a strict DASObjectStore application-identity registration:
one endpoint/ObjectStore/prefix, bounded operations and bytes, explicit expiry,
and opaque host/authority references only. It is not a live token exchange or
storage adapter. See [DASObjectStore application identity](docs/das-application-identity.rst).

The core now defines a bounded streaming object-ingest port: chunks are sent
directly to an authority backend, checksum and exact length are verified before
completion, backpressure is surfaced without buffering, and verified completion
is idempotent. It does not store media bytes locally. See
[streaming object ingest](docs/object-ingest.rst).

The core also defines an authorized object-read/cache handoff port. It validates
media type, length, SHA-256/ETag, conditional reads, ranges, and unavailable
states before exposing an authority stream; it never keeps a local media cache.
See [authorized object read](docs/object-read.rst).

The Web library now opens selected cards in a keyboard-controlled quick-preview
task pane with source/type/ObjectStore metadata, visible alt text, fit/original
view, explicit unavailable-object handling, and focus return. Only a ready
normalized ObjectStore video receives the host-authenticated range playback
route; there is no origin fallback. See
[quick preview](docs/quick-preview.rst).

Ready normalized videos now have an actor-bound Axum delivery route at
`/api/playback/v1/{playback_id}`. It accepts only a server-side scoped
DASObjectStore stream and host-injected Monas context, preserves a verified
MIME/length/ETag/single-range response, and has no origin fallback. Firefox
range, seek, pause, and resume evidence is reproducible with an ephemeral
worker output; see [direct normalized playback](docs/direct-playback.rst).

The Firefox cache foundation now has a bounded, host-authenticated alias lookup
endpoint. It admits only canonical query-free aliases for verified committed
objects, structurally separates observed thumbnails from explicitly opened
originals, rejects immutable identity conflicts, revalidates same-instance/site
policy, and returns explicit origin-fallback states for misses, stale records,
or unavailable authority. See [cache alias lookup](docs/cache-alias-lookup.rst).

x-img now validates a versioned metadata-only endpoint/device and ObjectStore
inventory. It distinguishes managed local folder profiles from paired HTTPS
appliances, requires stable endpoint-plus-store IDs and explicit defaults, and
rejects unmanaged folders, credentials, mutable identity, and arbitrary
first-store selection. See [destination contracts](docs/destinations.rst).

Reviewed destination selection now exposes all authority-visible endpoint/store
rows with word-first readiness states, keeps the explicit reviewed pair, and
fails commit-time revalidation on removal, rename, TLS, expiry, reconnect,
read-only, quota, or alias changes rather than switching storage.

The supported-toolchain, browser, Semantic Versioning, dependency, fixture,
CI, documentation, and Definition of Done rules are maintained in the
[release and quality policy](docs/release-quality-policy.rst). Run the
dependency-free planning checks with `scripts/quality/check.sh`; the pinned
local Sphinx container remains the documentation release authority.
GitHub Actions is currently a manually-dispatched advisory mirror only: its
absence or status never blocks development. Record the local checks and
backfill or migrate hosted CI later.

Cross-repository contract evidence is also dependency-free by default:
`scripts/contracts/check.sh` validates x-img-owned fixtures in a public clone.
Where the pinned sibling repositories are available, use
`scripts/contracts/check.sh --require-siblings` to inspect their exact commits
and required contract anchors. This does not use credentials or claim live
authority integration; see the release policy for the boundary.

The v1.0.0 product and brand target is **Pinakotheke**. Until the coordinated
release migration is complete, this public planning repository remains
`sagrudd/x-img`; the target repository slug is `sagrudd/pinakotheke` and all
compatibility aliases and migrations must be documented before that move.
The [Pinakotheke identity migration guide](docs/identity-migration.rst) records
the staged cutover, compatibility window, immutable data identities, and
rollback constraints.

## Key concerns before implementation

1. X and Instagram access, storage, display, and deletion obligations must be
   reviewed against current platform terms and the user's rights to each work.
2. Protected/private account access requires an official user-authorized flow;
   browser cookies and credentials must never be scraped or copied into x-img.
3. “Exactly once” is implemented as idempotent committed acquisition, not as an
   impossible promise that a network request can never be retried after a crash.
4. Video caching requires byte-range and segmented-media behavior to be proven
   in Firefox before the external-cache design is declared viable.
5. The public project must not redistribute downloaded media, tokens, account
   lists, DAS credentials, or Monas sessions.
6. Firefox capture and substitution are per-site opt-in and fail-open: the
   extension never automatically opens pages, traverses hidden content,
   bulk-crawls, simulates browsing, or forwards site cookies/credentials;
   thumbnails are eligible only after display/observation and originals only
   after an explicit user open. Avoiding an API does not exempt behavior from
   platform terms.
7. GEO, SRA, ENA, and NCBI resources require explicit accession/URL selection,
   rights/policy review, destination confirmation, checksum verification, and
   provenance; controlled-access or license-uncertain resources remain blocked.
8. Endpoint/device identity, logical ObjectStore identity, pairing, capability,
   health, quota, and TLS state are authority-owned; extension/browser storage
   never contains raw passwords, S3 secrets, or broad tokens.
9. Video normalization uses versioned, evidence-backed playback profiles and a
   pinned containerized FFmpeg adapter. DRM, unsupported media, rights-
   uncertain sources, and source-only renditions remain explicitly blocked or
   failed; browser capture does not avoid platform terms.
10. Direct normalized-video playback is host-authenticated and ObjectStore-only;
    it preserves verified range and ETag behavior without enabling a website
    cache rule or falling back to an origin URL.

## Versioning

The project uses Semantic Versioning. The workspace package version is the
single product-version authority and is currently `0.9.0`; the stable
connector, storage, Web, and Firefox contracts are the `1.0.0` gate.
