Endpoint and ObjectStore destinations
=====================================

x-img distinguishes a storage endpoint/device from a logical ObjectStore. The
stable endpoint ID identifies a managed local DASObjectStore service or a remote
appliance; the stable ObjectStore ID identifies one store discovered through
that endpoint. Display names are labels only and are never used as a write or
provenance identity.

The strict public contract is ``x-img.das-destination-inventory.v1``. Its
synthetic inventory fixtures cover a managed local folder profile, a remote
appliance with multiple stores, an explicit site override, and fail-closed
unmanaged-folder, mutable-ID, broad-secret, and arbitrary-first-store cases.
It was reviewed against DASObjectStore commit
``8368d34a365689e19321ecd6a35aab7c819268f6``. This is a copied x-img
contract, not a sibling path dependency or a live pairing client.

Local and remote setup
----------------------

The default local destination is a DASObjectStore-managed folder profile. The
x-img service may request and show its provisioning state, but it never accepts
an arbitrary filesystem path or writes a browser-selected folder directly.

Remote destinations begin with an HTTPS endpoint and a Monas-authenticated,
DASObjectStore-approved pairing. Browser and x-img configuration retain only
opaque host, provisioning, and pairing references. They never contain a raw
password, S3 secret, certificate, bearer token, or long-lived broad credential.

Selection and commit safety
---------------------------

After pairing, the authority supplies every visible ObjectStore. XIMG-037
exposes each one as a structured destination row; its future task pane will
show endpoint and store together, including stable IDs, labels, health, write
capability, quota, and compatible object types. It must show
``Ready``, ``Read-only``, ``Unavailable``, or ``Needs reconnect`` in words;
colour is only supplementary.

An endpoint with multiple stores requires an explicit default. A site or
resource plan may override that default, but every reviewed write remains bound
to one endpoint ID and one ObjectStore ID. x-img never chooses the first remote
store, silently falls back to another store, or treats a renamed label as a new
destination.

Immediately before a real commit, the server adapter must revalidate the
host context, pairing/TLS state, endpoint/store existence, health, writable
capability, object type, policy, quota, and reviewed stable-ID pair. The
catalogue provenance records endpoint ID, ObjectStore ID, object key, checksum,
actor/session reference, and commit time. XIMG-037 validates reviewed rows and
revalidates the exact stable-ID pair against authority state. A rendered Yew
task pane and live discovery/pairing transport remain future adapter work.
