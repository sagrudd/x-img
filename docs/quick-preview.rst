Quick preview and normalized video playback
===========================================

The library opens a selected media card in a focused preview task pane.  The
preview is a reading and playback surface, not an acquisition control: it never
opens an origin page, fetches a source URL, stores media bytes, or exposes a
credential.

Using the preview
-----------------

Each preview names the selected record and keeps the following evidence visible:

* source account/origin label, capture time, media type, ObjectStore state, and
  descriptive alt text;
* a ``Fit to pane`` / ``View original size`` control for the visual area;
* a source-metadata link, rather than a hidden source navigation; and
* an explicit ``Object unavailable`` state when an authorized object cannot be
  read.  That state never falls back to the source URL.

The dedicated **Playable videos** browse context filters at the server before
pagination. New normalized video cards show duration and codec families at a
glance. The preview adds exact dimensions, versioned playback profile, and the
worded ``Ready · Firefox verified`` normalization state. Legacy video records
without the additive metadata remain readable but do not invent evidence.

Normalized video
----------------

Only a record marked ``Stored in ObjectStore`` with a verified normalized
playback identifier receives a native HTML video control.  Its URL is the
host-authenticated x-img route:

.. code-block:: text

   /products/pinakotheke/api/gallery/v1/objects/{catalogue_id}/video

A WebP poster, when generated, is a separate DASObjectStore object delivered
through the corresponding ``thumbnail`` role. Poster availability never
determines video availability: the status and provenance shown for a normalized
video come from its committed video representation. The video route preserves
the verified MIME type, ETag, and a single byte range; see
:doc:`direct-playback`. A video without a ready ObjectStore rendition remains
visibly unavailable or non-playable. The Web client does not supply an origin
URL as a backup.

Keyboard behavior
-----------------

Opening a card moves focus to the preview.  ``Tab`` and ``Shift+Tab`` cycle
through preview actions, ``Escape`` closes the pane, and closing returns focus
to the selected card.  The pane uses words, not colour alone, for object and
delivery state.

Verification
------------

The installed-Firefox gallery harness builds and opens the real Yew bundle. It
proves the dedicated video filter and metadata, bounded virtual window,
keyboard focus, unavailable state, responsive layout, and that unavailable
media causes no request to an origin website. The playback harness accepts only
an ephemeral normalized MP4 and proves metadata load, seeking, concurrent and
conditional ranges, cancellation, pause/resume, and missing-object recovery.
It removes its Firefox profile and retains no media.
