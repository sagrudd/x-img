Local Pinakotheke monolith
==========================

``pinakotheke-monolith`` is the local-first distribution framework for a
coherent Pinakotheke web service. It does not merge security authorities:
Monas/Prosopikon continues to own login and sessions, and DASObjectStore
continues to own all durable media bytes. The foreground service now recognizes
a reviewed DASObjectStore-managed local profile while Monas authentication
remains visibly unavailable.

Start on macOS
--------------

Run as the ordinary local user, never with ``sudo``:

.. code-block:: console

   cargo run -p pinakotheke-cli --bin pinakotheke -- serve

The default listener is ``http://127.0.0.1:8731`` and the default product root
is ``~/.x-img``. An explicit alternative must be absolute:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke serve --root "$HOME/.x-img" --port 8731

Startup creates only private mode-``0700`` metadata directories:

.. code-block:: text

   ~/.x-img/
     config/
     state/
     run/
     logs/

The root and its required children must be real directories, not symlinks.
Provision local ObjectStore authority
-------------------------------------

Docker Desktop must be running. Review the plan, then ask DASObjectStore's
canonical helper to provision the bounded profile:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke storage local-profile plan \
     --provisioner /absolute/path/to/DASObjectStore/deploy/local-docker/local.sh
   pinakotheke storage local-profile provision \
     --provisioner /absolute/path/to/DASObjectStore/deploy/local-docker/local.sh

The authority owns ``~/.x-img/dasobjectstore`` and the named
``pinakotheke_local`` logical ObjectStore. Private Garage configuration and
keys remain under ``~/.config/dasobjectstore``. Pinakotheke stores only the
secret-free stable endpoint/ObjectStore selection in its metadata state; it
never writes media by treating the managed root as an ordinary folder.

Use ``status`` to re-discover and validate the authority identity, or ``down``
to stop the containers without deleting state. Both accept the same required
``--provisioner`` argument. An alternate ``--root`` must be absolute.

Provisioning is restart-safe. If the authority's start action reports failure
but strict ``describe`` immediately returns the exact expected Ready profile,
endpoint, ObjectStore, API URL, and credential reference, Pinakotheke records
that reconciled identity. If rediscovery is missing, changed, or unhealthy, the
original start failure remains fatal and no selection is written.

Readiness
---------

``GET /health`` reports coarse process liveness. ``GET /ready`` reports three
worded component states. In the first slice, ``pinakotheke`` is ``Ready`` while
``monas_authentication`` is ``Not configured``. ``dasobjectstore`` becomes
``Ready`` only when the exact secret-free managed selection has been persisted;
the overall state remains ``not_ready`` until Monas is composed. Authenticated
product and media routes are not mounted yet.

Trusted Monas dispatch boundary
-------------------------------

The XIMG-092 ingress slice accepts authenticated product requests only after a
Monas-owned dispatcher supplies both a validated, non-secret
``x-img.host-context.v1`` document and a process-local dispatch credential.
The credential is not a browser session and must never be placed in a browser,
URL, configuration JSON, or log. Pass its private mode-``0600`` file to the
backend listener:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke serve \
     --monas-dispatch-token-file "$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token"

The protected proof route is
``/products/pinakotheke/api/context``. A direct request, a forged credential,
an invalid context, or a context lacking ``ximg.access`` is rejected. The two
dispatch headers are removed before product code runs. When configured,
readiness reports the trusted dispatch boundary as ``Ready``; this means only
that the backend is prepared for Monas dispatch, not that a login has occurred.

Monas ``0.3.0`` provides the matching authenticated forwarding mount and login
screen. Create
one private credential and start the backend on a separate loopback port, then
start Monas as the only user-facing listener:

.. code-block:: console

   install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.x-img/run"
   (umask 077; openssl rand -hex 32 > "$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token")
   pinakotheke serve --port 8732 \
     --monas-dispatch-token-file "$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token"

.. code-block:: console

   MONAS_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8731 \
   PINAKOTHEKE_UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:8732 \
   PINAKOTHEKE_DISPATCH_TOKEN_FILE="$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token" \
   monas-server

Open ``http://127.0.0.1:8731/products/pinakotheke/app/``. Monas verifies its
Prosopikon cookie, generates the correlation identifier, strips the cookie and
any caller-supplied dispatch headers, and streams to the backend. Pinakotheke
never parses the cookie or issues login, session, or logout state. Keep port
8732 loopback-only; direct protected requests remain rejected.

Build and mount the Yew application
-----------------------------------

Build the browser application locally with the checked-in Trunk document and
WebAssembly start entry:

.. code-block:: console

   make web

This writes hashed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly files to
``dist/web`` with the canonical ``/products/pinakotheke/app/`` public URL. No
sibling source tree or unpublished path dependency is used. The semantic-token
mirror records ``mnemosyne_design_language`` commit
``5539df8f662a78ebdf7cf4c868d71831380c8cfd``; Monas remains responsible for
the approved host branding and login assets.

Point the backend at the reviewed build directory:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke serve --port 8732 \
     --web-root "$PWD/dist/web" \
     --monas-dispatch-token-file "$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token"

Alternatively, copy the complete build into ``~/.x-img/web`` and omit
``--web-root``. Pinakotheke accepts only an absolute, symlink-free tree with a
regular ``index.html``, at most 128 files, and at most 32 MiB. Missing default
assets leave the app mount unconfigured rather than serving a placeholder as
the gallery.

The entire app mount is protected by Monas dispatch. A direct request to the
backend app path returns ``401``; after Monas authenticates the user, the same
path serves the Yew document and its hashed assets. Catalogue and object routes
retain their independent host-context checks. Native tests prove both direct
denial and admitted static delivery. Native packages install this web build at
the platform path embedded in the monolith.

Compose ObjectStore delivery
----------------------------

Supply a reviewed host/DASObjectStore adapter to make persisted gallery objects
readable through the same authenticated monolith:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke serve --port 8732 \
     --object-read-helper /absolute/path/to/reviewed-helper \
     --capture-authority-file /absolute/path/to/capture-authority.json \
     --capture-completion-token-file /absolute/path/to/completion.token \
     --capture-acquire-helper /absolute/path/to/reviewed-acquire-helper \
     --monas-dispatch-token-file "$HOME/.x-img/run/monas-dispatch.token"

The helper uses the strict ``pinakotheke.object-read-helper.v1`` protocol
documented in :doc:`object-read`. It receives object identity metadata only and
streams bytes directly from DASObjectStore. It must own scoped authentication;
do not wrap an arbitrary download command or expose credentials through its
arguments. With the helper configured, the compiled Yew app, catalogue, image
preview, poster, and normalized-video range routes are composed together behind
Monas dispatch. Without it, object delivery remains unmounted and the UI shows
the explicit unavailable state rather than consulting an origin URL.

For image acquisition, the packaged Pinakotheke binary can itself be the
reviewed acquire helper. Configure the strict secret-free DAS adapter described
in :doc:`firefox-capture`, then set ``--capture-acquire-helper`` to the absolute
Pinakotheke binary path. DAS credentials and provider completion remain owned
by ``dasobjectstore-remote`` and ``dasobjectstored``; Pinakotheke retains only
the verified object reference and gallery metadata.

``make firefox-gallery-check`` independently exercises the compiled bundle in
installed Firefox. It uses an ephemeral loopback catalogue and private Firefox
profiles; it proves the browser component, not the local Monas and
DASObjectStore authorities.

Stop the foreground process with ``Control-C``. Axum stops accepting new work
and completes graceful shutdown.

Per-user macOS service
----------------------

Review and install the two coordinated user agents:

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke service plan
   pinakotheke service install \
     --pinakotheke-binary /absolute/path/to/pinakotheke \
     --monas-binary /absolute/path/to/monas-server \
     --object-read-helper /absolute/path/to/reviewed-helper \
     --object-read-endpoint-id endpoint-local \
     --capture-authority-file /absolute/path/to/capture-authority.json \
     --capture-completion-token-file /absolute/path/to/completion.token \
     --capture-acquire-helper /absolute/path/to/reviewed-acquire-helper

Installation requires absolute executable regular files, generates a private
dispatch credential, keeps the backend on port 8732, and exposes Monas on port
8731. The helper is optional until a reviewed DASObjectStore implementation is
installed. Its path and stable reviewed endpoint identity must be supplied
together; the backend agent retains both and exposes the identity to the helper
as ``PINAKOTHEKE_OBJECT_READ_ENDPOINT_ID``. The identity is scope, not a
credential, and the helper must authenticate independently. Prosopikon remains
under ``~/.config/monas/prosopikon``; Pinakotheke
metadata and logs remain under ``~/.x-img``; DASObjectStore retains its own
authority roots.

When capture planning is configured, accepted metadata is journalled at
``~/.x-img/state/capture-plans.v1.json`` before success is returned. Restarting
either foreground or launchd operation reloads the pending actor-scoped plans
and preserves idempotent retries; the journal contains no media payloads.

.. code-block:: console

   pinakotheke service status
   pinakotheke service logs
   pinakotheke service logs --follow
   pinakotheke service restart
   pinakotheke service uninstall

Existing definitions are never overwritten implicitly. After review, use
``install --replace``; replacement restores the prior pair if launchd admission
fails. Uninstall removes only the service definitions. Configuration,
credentials, logs, catalogue state, Prosopikon users, and ObjectStore data are
preserved.

Network safety
--------------

Loopback is the default and recommended binding. A non-loopback address is
refused unless the operator supplies the deliberately explicit
``--allow-non-loopback-without-authentication`` acknowledgement. The option is
for controlled development only: it prints a warning and does not create TLS or
authentication. Do not expose this first slice to an untrusted network.

Next slices
-----------

XIMG-094 still proves a clean-home authenticated ingest/read/restart flow end
to end. The host read adapter and first-party scoped DAS/S3 helper are now
available. A real isolated profile provisions and rediscovers successfully on
macOS after the DASObjectStore local image consumes its copied Prosopikon build
context. The remaining authority gap is transport: Docker Desktop exposes the
container-created Unix socket path on a bind mount but refuses host
connections. DASObjectStore must provide a supported host-reachable daemon
transport or package ``dasobjectstore-remote`` inside the authority container;
direct S3 writes are not accepted as verified completion. See :doc:`object-read`
for the private helper configuration.
