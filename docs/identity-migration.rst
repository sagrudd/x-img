Pinakotheke identity migration
==============================

Pinakotheke is the v1.0.0 product name. Until the coordinated v1.0.0 release
is complete, this public planning repository and its technical identifiers
remain ``x-img``. An individual documentation, package, or URL update is not
the product migration.

What changes at v1.0.0
----------------------

The user-facing name, documentation, executable, package/product metadata,
Monas and future Synoptikon label, Firefox listing, and canonical GitHub
repository become Pinakotheke and ``sagrudd/pinakotheke``. Controlled clones
are updated after the cutover:

.. code-block:: console

   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/sagrudd/pinakotheke.git

GitHub redirects the old repository URL, but the redirect is not a permanent
interface and the old ``sagrudd/x-img`` name must not be recreated.

Cutover rehearsal
-----------------

The local identity transition is rehearsed as one transaction before any live
repository or authority is changed:

.. code-block:: console

   python3 scripts/release/check_v1_rehearsal.py

The command creates an isolated temporary copy, moves every Rust package to its
canonical ``pinakotheke-*`` path and package name, updates the workspace to
1.0.0 and the canonical repository, activates copies of the reviewed Monas and
DASObjectStore candidates, installs the reviewed Firefox identity, and updates
the public documentation lead. It then compiles and tests the renamed workspace
and runs the strict local cutover and package-source gates. The live 0.9 tree is
never modified and the temporary copy is deleted after verification.

The rehearsal also runs the renamed repository's complete local quality,
dependency/license/security audit, nine-case fault-recovery, public contract,
and package-source suites. Release helpers select canonical crate paths,
Pinakotheke is the default package identity, and package builders consume the
activated Monas registration and Firefox manifest rather than the inert review
candidates. This prevents a cutover that passes compilation but leaves release
operations tied to pre-1.0 paths or inactive authority documents.

The underlying transformer requires both an explicit root and ``--apply``. It
is a release-operator mechanism, not an ordinary development command. During
the real cutover it must be used only after the canonical GitHub repository and
authority-owner change window are confirmed; the final ``make v1-cutover``
still verifies the live repository and cannot be bypassed by a successful
rehearsal.

What stays stable
-----------------

Existing schemas, catalogue identities, ObjectStore references, checksums,
provenance/audit events, and a signed Firefox extension ID are data-bearing
identities. They are not rewritten just to match the new brand. Configuration
and pairings are read unchanged or migrated through a reviewable, backed-up,
idempotent operation. A migration never moves media out of DASObjectStore or
silently selects a different endpoint or ObjectStore.

Compatibility and recovery
--------------------------

The legacy ``x-img`` aliases remain for the later of twelve months after v1.0.0
or two subsequent minor releases. They show a clear migration notice. Removing
them requires a major release unless an urgent security, privacy, legal, or
data-integrity issue requires earlier removal.

Before cutover, operators receive a migration report, backup/export reference,
compatibility result, and rollback instructions. After a GitHub rename,
recovery keeps the canonical repository: recreating the old repository removes
GitHub's redirect. For data, recovery uses a compatible reader or backup;
committed ObjectStore bytes are never rewritten or deleted for branding.

The detailed sequence, surface inventory, and required proof cases are in
:doc:`adr/0011-pinakotheke-v1-identity-migration`.

Executable cutover gate
-----------------------

The migration is enforced rather than inferred from documentation. Run the
inventory-safe preflight at any time:

.. code-block:: console

   make v1-preflight

It validates the exact migration surface inventory and reports every identity
that is not yet canonical. Blockers are expected in a 0.9 release and do not
make preflight fail. The actual release command is intentionally strict:

.. code-block:: console

   make v1-cutover

It also queries the public canonical GitHub repository and exits unsuccessfully
unless version, repository, Rust packages, CLI plus legacy wrapper, Monas and
DASObjectStore registrations, Firefox identity, documentation, legacy schema
reader, migration proof, and GitHub state are all ready together. A failed
cutover check is a release refusal, not a checklist warning. The report contains
surface names only and never reads credentials, media, browsing history, or
ObjectStore records.

CLI compatibility preparation
-----------------------------

The 0.9 source builds both command entry points from one clap parser. The
``pinakotheke`` command is the canonical v1 entry point. The ``x-img`` command
parses and executes the same arguments and emits a bounded compatibility notice
to standard error. It remains the only command installed by 0.9 packages, so
preparing compatibility does not perform a partial public rename. At the
coordinated v1 cutover, packages install both names and documentation leads with
``pinakotheke``. The alias is retained through the documented compatibility
window.
