# Changelog

All notable changes to x-img will be documented in this file. The project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planning

- Added the Pinakotheke v1.0.0 coordinated rename/rebrand gate, including
  compatibility aliases and repository migration planning.
- Added the Sphinx/Read the Docs local-container documentation authority and
  stricter Firefox observation, opt-in, fail-open, and status-display rules.
- Added the planned explicit GEO/SRA/ENA/NCBI resource workflow: reviewable
  accession plans, rights gates, direct DASObjectStore streaming, checksum and
  provenance requirements, optional Aspera with HTTPS fallback, and no bulk
  discovery or durable x-img-local payloads.
- Added endpoint/device versus logical ObjectStore planning: managed local
  folder-profile bootstrap, remote HTTPS pairing and discovery, explicit
  endpoint-plus-store selection, commit-time capability checks, stable-ID
  provenance, and safe reconnect behavior without silent destination changes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Initial public planning baseline.
- Dependency-ordered milestones and TODO backlog for X, Instagram, Firefox,
  Monas, DASObjectStore, and future Synoptikon integration.

  commits, immediate pushes, data authority, privacy, and design conformance.
- Mozilla Public License 2.0.
